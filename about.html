Hi!  This is my own personal section of the void that I like to scream into.  Here's a few of my favorite articles:

<h3><a href="/articles/Valley-Talent.html">Valley Talent</a></h3>

<div>A long time ago (at least it feels like that), I moved out to San Francisco in hopes of meeting real programmers.  As it turns out, there's a lot of variety out here.  The startup I had (poorly) chosen was full of folks who talked a big game and couldn't back it up.  I was crestfallen.  To make things worse, I discovered that there's an anti-startup bias in the global tech community, using examples like Yo as 'evidence' that nothing a startup made could be worth anything.  <a href="/articles/Valley-Talent.html" class="article-title">Valley Talent</a> came out of these frusterations.  It also holds a special place in my heart for being the first thing I wrote to hit the front page of HackerNews without my prodding (thanks, <a href="https://twitter.com/danluu">@danluu</a>!)</div>

<h3><a href="/articles/The-Myth-of-Equity-as-Motivation.html">The Myth of Equity as Motivation</a></h3>

<div>A year of time and several years of experience later, I worked at a slightly bigger startup.  The CEO kept telling us just how rich we would be once the company exited for billions of dollars, all while insisting on a minimum of 60-hour weeks.  The math didn't add up and so I wrote <a class="article-title" href="/articles/The-Myth-of-Equity-as-Motivation.html">The Myth of Equity as Motivation</a>.  I nearly got fired over it.  Lesson learned!</div>

<h3><a href="/2016/04/06/Hacking-Calculords.html">Hacking Calculords</a></h3>

<div>Alright, no more startup angst.  This one's just some programming fun.  I got nerd-sniped by a mobile game and... y'know what?  Go read the article, it's a fun romp: <a href="/2016/04/06/Hacking-Calculords.html">Hacking Calculords</a></div>
