Decades of management tradition tell us that Someone must be in charge and make sure everyone&#39;s doing their work.  Otherwise, everyone will goof off, right?</p>
<p>And yet, somehow these companies manage to work out.  I&#39;m not even talking about the big ones that hog all the attention (looking at you, GitHub).  Big, flat companies are wonderful case studies on their own but, much like quantum physics, it&#39;s when things reach the tiny startup scale that they start to get weird.  A team of five won&#39;t have a full-time manager (unless something goes drastically wrong).  How do things get done?  Who decides what to do next?  What happens when (gasp) <em>people disagree</em>?</p>
<p>I am by no means an expert in this topic.  Rather, this essay has been written as a letter to my college self, containing what I wish I had known back then about flat management.  I hope you learn something!</p>
<p>Management does not get the attention it deserves in a small startup fighting for its life (much like everything else).  I&#39;ve seen startups tear themselves apart like an off-center centrifuge thanks to a lack of focus or unwillingness to Make Tough Decisions.  Managing people will be the hardest thing you do as a founder.</p>
<p>This is why we see the default for companies at this stage to be declaring themselves &quot;flat&quot;.  At the surface, it seems like a good idea.  &quot;I&#39;ve hired smart people&quot; you, the founder, might think.  &quot;They can take care of themselves while I focus on the many other things that are currently on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>To a certain extent, you&#39;re absolutely right.  If you haven&#39;t hired smart people, stop reading this and go fix that situation by any means necessary.  If you have hired smart people, congrats!  Step one completed.  On to steps two through eight bazillion!  For argument&#39;s sake, let&#39;s define flat as &quot;Delegation of 100% of management tasks&quot; (excluding administrative things like paperwork and talking to lawyers).  This is in contrast to a hybrid model where long-term decisions are passed down but employees are largely free to implement as they see fit.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try and answer the three questions from the opening paragraph with the &quot;100% delegation&quot; model:</p>
<h4 id="how-do-things-get-done-">How do things get done?</h4>
<p>You&#39;ve hired smart, motivated people who enjoy what they do.  Getting good programmers to program is not a hard task (in fact, <em>stopping</em> them from programming might be harder).  No problems here.</p>
<h4 id="who-decides-what-to-do-next-">Who decides what to do next?</h4>
<p>Ah, here&#39;s where things start getting tricky.  One of the main troubles with hackers is that we tend to dive into a rabbit hole and keep exploring.  Getting to 100% coverage or utilizing that nifty new tool might feel awesome but it&#39;s not propelling the product forward.  We&#39;re delegating all the things, so we can&#39;t create a TODO list and tell everyone to follow that.  What do we do?</p>
<p>Remember the dozens of articles talking about the importance of &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;mission&quot; that hit HN every week?  You can&#39;t throw a rock in San Francisco without hitting someone talking about how important mission and culture are (speaking of, try and create a culture of not throwing rocks at people - it does wonders for recruiting).  If you create a setting where things get done in a given style, others will follow.  Your team members can weigh their next action on &quot;Does it follow the mission?&quot; without any additional input from you.  100% delegation achieved.  Well, 99.9% delegation; you&#39;ll still need to decide on a mission, but it scales after that.</p>
<p>A practical example of this is how an employee deals with a problem they can&#39;t overcome.  They could continue attacking the problem, take a short break, or interrupt a coworker and ask for help.  All of these are reasonable options but the one that&#39;s selected depends on the priorities of the company.  Is uninterrupted work time more valuable than a fast answer?  Is it acceptable to browse Facebook while you shunt the problem to a mental background process?</p>
<p>Other critical questions in day-to-day work include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are teams formed?</li>
<li>How important are tests?</li>
<li>What frameworks/plugins/etc should we use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a culture that answers these problems is outside the scope of this essay.  If you&#39;re interested, check out the two culture talks from Sam Altman&#39;s Startup Class: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWgVWGEuGE">part 1</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8Dl8rZ6qwE">part 2</a></p>
<h4 id="what-happens-when-people-disagree-">What happens when people disagree?</h4>
<p>Most of the time, disagreements are amicable and resolve themselves without external intervention.  I&#39;ve had cases where, after 15 minutes of fruitless discussion on what pattern was best, we put it to the gods of <code>Math.random()</code> to decide for us.  These are cases where 100% delegation works out fine.</p>
<p>We are still human, despite Kurzweil&#39;s best efforts, and there will still be times when we just don&#39;t get along.  The worst thing you can do here is to remain vigilantly neutral.  When conflict flares up, you can&#39;t delegate the task of making sure everyone gets along.  Sometimes things get so bad you have to step in.  It&#39;s important to remember that those involved in the scuffle honestly do believe they&#39;re in the right - coming down with the hammer of &quot;You were in the wrong, so stop it&quot; will not encourage a healthy workplace.  Building rapport through empathy (<a href="https://getlighthouse.com/blog/building-rapport/">https://getlighthouse.com/blog/building-rapport/</a>) will be an incredibly powerful tool in the rare situations when you have to drop out of 100% mode.  I promise - it&#39;ll make everyone&#39;s lives easier.</p>
<h4 id="hiring">Hiring</h4>
<p>Deciding which potential employees to bring on is bit trickier.  I believe that the only rational hiring process is a centralized one.  Without a centralized, objective process, the selection criteria chosen by the typical engineer is too variable for hiring to be performed in an objective manner.  This centralization breaks the 100% model.</p>
<p>As a field, we&#39;re absolutely rubbish at interviewing.  Most of the things we use to evaluate candidates (tricky logic puzzles, reciting algorithms from memory, ambiguous &quot;fit&quot;) either do not judge the candidate on work skills, or worse, depend entirely on the interviewer&#39;s mood.  With 100% delegation, each employee selects their own interviewing style, making it difficult to evaluate and compare candidates.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll need to set a standard for candidate evaluation by ensuring your employees know <em>how</em> to run an objective interview and modeling it yourself.  Once things are set in place, it is much easier to maintain momentum.  An excellent treatise on the subject can be found here: <a href="http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/">http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/</a></p>
<p>You may think otherwise about any of the concepts presented here - if you do, please write about it!  I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
</div><hr><h3 class="heading"><a href="/articles/Valley-Talent.html">Valley Talent</a></h3><div><p><em>&quot;Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit.  Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad&quot; -Anonymous</em></p>
<p>One common refrain from experienced engineers outside of Silicon Valley is that &#39;nothing SV cranks out requires any talent&#39;.  Seeing that I&#39;m an engineer turning that very same SV crank, I immediately took offense.  What?!?  How could anyone say that these amazing new apps put together with generators, Bootstrap and the latest over-hyped database...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll concede that point.  As I&#39;ve thought about this more, I&#39;ve found some truth in the statement - but not as much as those who spout it might want.  There&#39;s plenty of evidence that both sides are equally correct, just in different microcosms.</p>
<p>Before going any further, let&#39;s define a few terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge is anything you can look up.</li>
<li>Talent is anything you can&#39;t look up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gluing together a MVP calendar app with Bootstrap, Angular and a Mongo wrapper takes knowledge.  There might be a few APIs and libraries to install but all of those can be condensed to a few StackOverflow questions.  Building something people can love and use for years takes talent.</p>
<p>With that in mind, does anything produced in the Bay Area require talent?</p>
<h5 id="absolutely-not">Absolutely not</h5>
<p>The startup culture of Silicon Valley is all about getting things off the ground.  If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve noticed while writing my wild array of scatterbrained projects, it&#39;s that the most tedious thing is getting it off of the ground.  Setting up a basic page, site structure and plan are all basic evils that must be addressed before any of the fun work can be done.  Us coders have a glut of frameworks and libraries offering to do the heavy lifting for us.  Early on, nothing more than knowledge is needed to put things together.  Grab some templates and a generator or two and you&#39;re good to go.  You don&#39;t even need to be aware of server administration, as deployment is nothing more than <code>git push heroku master</code>.</p>
<p>Naturally, many of these fail.  As is the nature of the Valley, most of the team will either be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring">acquihired</a> or move on to other new projects, repeating the same cycles, building the same-but-just-different-enough CRUD applications to disrupt something or other.  Continually running through the same starting procedures means that knowledge is built up, but talent is never accrued [0].  Often, the engineers won&#39;t realize that their career is on a treadmill - moving fast but going nowhere.  Rarely will anyone in this cycle wonder why companies founded by those who&#39;ve never grown beyond CRUD continue failing when talent beyond CRUD is required, a mistake that can kill a career.</p>
<p>If this is the endless cycle of no talent, where are all the &#39;talented&#39; engineers?  Well, they&#39;re a little further south.</p>
<h5 id="absolutely">Absolutely</h5>
<p>Sometimes startups don&#39;t fail and start growing.  The task of scaling technology, revenue or people is complex and can&#39;t be found in a blog.  The guys who put this together don&#39;t read the docs - they probably wrote them.  They depend upon years of practice finding edge cases, studying the core of a language and hard, non-Googleable work, one detail at a time.  These guys are the ones pulling down the seemingly-obscene salaries - and yet they&#39;re worth it.  Every single IPO or huge acquisition involved these guys creating a massive amount of value.</p>
<p>These fantastic coders are where we get the culture of engineering superiority and the idea that some engineers can produce work that&#39;s an order of magnitude better than others.  It&#39;s easy to idolize them, pretending that their talent was forged in some mysterious Stanford backroom.  For the most part, the high cabal of Silicon Valley engineers started out like everyone else, building simple projects through tutorials.  Unfortunately, anyone with half an engineering degree tends to believe that they are these fabled &#39;10xers&#39;, and are nothing short of Torvalds himself.  The phrase &#39;Growth Hacker&#39; was briefly used to describe this second group, but was immediately co-opted by everyone who had &#39;growth hacked&#39; their Twitter account to 150 followers.  Instead, they continue to run the mobius loop of knowledge and failure, never understanding why they aren&#39;t getting anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there any hope for someone currently bound by their lack of talent?  Absolutely.  Find one of many open source projects and start sweating the details.  Find code you don&#39;t understand and go through it line-by-line until you&#39;ve grasped all you can.  Most of all, understand that playing <em>Mary Had a Little Lamb</em> a million times won&#39;t make it easier for you to write a symphony.</p>
<p>It&#39;s very easy to be dismissive of the many &#39;me too&#39; startups hanging around San Francisco coffee shops.  There&#39;s real value and talent going on - go out and find it.</p>
</div><hr><h3 class="heading"><a href="/articles/Dont-start-a-hosting-company.html">Don't start a hosting company</a></h3><div><p>I talk to a lot of people who are just starting their first startup.  An large percentage of them want to know what it&#39;ll take to start a webhosting company.  This isn&#39;t surprising, as web hosting companies like GoDaddy are very visible.  The first step to any project is some sort of hosting.  The technical challenges don&#39;t seem overwhelming to the beginner - chances are, they&#39;ve played with some sort of server already.  Most importantly, hosting services seem to make a <em>lot</em> of money.  To the uninitiated, this seems like a great area to enter.  In this essay, I hope to explain why you shouldn&#39;t start a hosting service, while also explaining more general pitfalls beginners encounter.</p>
<h5 id="current-market-size-rarely-matters">Current market size rarely matters</h5>
<p>Lots of beginners fall for the <a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2013/03/11/the-1-percent-fallacy/">1% fallacy</a> (the idea that all they need to succeed is 1% of the market) when selecting what to build.  They see large, entrenched players as a good sign - there&#39;s money to be made here.  Large companies are particularly keen on not letting an upstart steal their profits.  More than likely, they&#39;ll steal whatever makes you special and you&#39;ll lose your customers.</p>
<p>Every major tech company has had either an entirely new product or one that was ten times as good as the competition. &quot;Yet another hosting company&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it. [0]</p>
<p>Speaking of that...</p>
<h5 id="you-re-not-special">You&#39;re not special</h5>
<p>You&#39;ll need to do something to differentiate yourself from other companies - it&#39;s called a competitive advantage.  It&#39;ll be hard to compete on price with the big guys and their massive scale.  Most other factors are just as difficult - bandwidth, server power and uptime are all costly.  Ease of use may be one option.  Heroku made it incredibly easy for developers to get an app online and keep it updated.  Digital Ocean has won many customers based on their easy-to-use administration panel.  You&#39;d need to find a target demographic that doesn&#39;t have their particular interests served and build something for them.  The trouble is finding a niche in between developer-friendly solutions like DO and Heroku and non-technical people that just need a Wordpress install [1].</p>
<h5 id="it-s-not-easy">It&#39;s not easy</h5>
<p>I remember setting up my first server and finally coaxing Ubuntu 8.10 to life.  It&#39;s a wonderful experience seeing a web page you wrote load, and fairly easy to repeat once the basic steps are learned.  Selling web hosting space is <em>much</em> more difficult.  You&#39;ll need to consider how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolate different servers (cheaply!) so that users can only access their own data?</li>
<li>Give everyone a fair share of the server&#39;s resources?</li>
<li>Determine how much you bill for what?</li>
<li>Prevent hardware failure (and what do you do when the inevitable happens?)</li>
<li>Design a dashboard that people want to use (i.e. not cPanel)</li>
<li>Send email!</li>
<li>Deal with spammers using your service</li>
<li>Deal with the FBI when they accuse you of assisting software pirates (or worse!)</li>
</ul>
<p>This last section is not an explicit reason to not start a web hosting company, but as an example of how difficult starting anything is [2].  Most who want found web hosting companies chose hosting because &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot; - even though they couldn&#39;t answer the above questions.  This shouldn&#39;t be insulting, everyone was a novice at some point.  A good exercise to learn more in this area is to use a competitor&#39;s product.  Go through the process slowly.  Think about what it will take to copy each of their features [3].</p>
<p>This being said, there are still plenty of opportunities to find in the startup space.  Your first, tenth or even hundredth idea doesn&#39;t have to be the one.  Keep building new things, learn from your mistakes, and eventually something will stick.</p>
<p>[0] It should be noted that while Google started in an already-crowded market, they had a product that was orders of magnitude better than the others.  For more on this, see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo</a></p>
<p>[1] An argument could be made that WP installs <em>are</em> a form of web hosting.  If I haven&#39;t convinced you to do something other than hosting, this may be a lucrative way to start.</p>
<p>[2] The business side of things has been deliberately left out.  However, these can be just as hard as the technical stuff.</p>
<p>[3] If you notice anything particularly annoying across the board, there may be opportunity there to do it <em>right</em> and differentiate yourself.</p>
