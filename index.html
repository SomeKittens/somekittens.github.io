Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad&quot; -Anonymous</em></p>
<p>One common refrain from experienced engineers outside of Silicon Valley is that &#39;nothing SV cranks out requires any talent&#39;.  Seeing that I&#39;m an engineer turning that very same SV crank, I immediately took offense.  What?!?  How could anyone say that these amazing new apps put together with generators, Bootstrap and the latest over-hyped database...</p>
<p>I&#39;ll concede that point.  As I&#39;ve thought about this more, I&#39;ve found some truth in the statement - but not as much as those who spout it might want.  There&#39;s plenty of evidence that both sides are equally correct, just in different microcosms.</p>
<p>Before going any further, let&#39;s define a few terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge is anything you can look up.</li>
<li>Talent is anything you can&#39;t look up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gluing together a MVP calendar app with Bootstrap, Angular and a Mongo wrapper takes knowledge.  There might be a few APIs and libraries to install but all of those can be condensed to a few StackOverflow questions.  Building something people can love and use for years takes talent.</p>
<p>With that in mind, does anything produced in the Bay Area require talent?</p>
<h5 id="absolutely-not">Absolutely not</h5>
<p>The startup culture of Silicon Valley is all about getting things off the ground.  If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve noticed while writing my wild array of scatterbrained projects, it&#39;s that the most tedious thing is getting it off of the ground.  Setting up a basic page, site structure and plan are all basic evils that must be addressed before any of the fun work can be done.  Us coders have a glut of frameworks and libraries offering to do the heavy lifting for us.  Early on, nothing more than knowledge is needed to put things together.  Grab some templates and a generator or two and you&#39;re good to go.  You don&#39;t even need to be aware of server administration, as deployment is nothing more than <code>git push heroku master</code>.</p>
<p>Naturally, many of these fail.  As is the nature of the Valley, most of the team will either be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acqui-hiring">acquihired</a> or move on to other new projects, repeating the same cycles, building the same-but-just-different-enough CRUD applications to disrupt something or other.  Continually running through the same starting procedures means that knowledge is built up, but talent is never accrued [0].  Often, the engineers won&#39;t realize that their career is on a treadmill - moving fast but going nowhere.  Rarely will anyone in this cycle wonder why companies founded by those who&#39;ve never grown beyond CRUD continue failing when talent beyond CRUD is required, a mistake that can kill a career.</p>
<p>If this is the endless cycle of no talent, where are all the &#39;talented&#39; engineers?  Well, they&#39;re a little further south.</p>
<h5 id="absolutely">Absolutely</h5>
<p>Sometimes startups don&#39;t fail and start growing.  The task of scaling technology, revenue or people is complex and can&#39;t be found in a blog.  The guys who put this together don&#39;t read the docs - they probably wrote them.  They depend upon years of practice finding edge cases, studying the core of a language and hard, non-Googleable work, one detail at a time.  These guys are the ones pulling down the seemingly-obscene salaries - and yet they&#39;re worth it.  Every single IPO or huge acquisition involved these guys creating a massive amount of value.</p>
<p>These fantastic coders are where we get the culture of engineering superiority and the idea that some engineers can produce work that&#39;s an order of magnitude better than others.  It&#39;s easy to idolize them, pretending that their talent was forged in some mysterious Stanford backroom.  For the most part, the high cabal of Silicon Valley engineers started out like everyone else, building simple projects through tutorials.  Unfortunately, anyone with half an engineering degree tends to believe that they are these fabled &#39;10xers&#39;, and are nothing short of Torvalds himself.  The phrase &#39;Growth Hacker&#39; was briefly used to describe this second group, but was immediately co-opted by everyone who had &#39;growth hacked&#39; their Twitter account to 150 followers.  Instead, they continue to run the mobius loop of knowledge and failure, never understanding why they aren&#39;t getting anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there any hope for someone currently bound by their lack of talent?  Absolutely.  Find one of many open source projects and start sweating the details.  Find code you don&#39;t understand and go through it line-by-line until you&#39;ve grasped all you can.  Most of all, understand that playing <em>Mary Had a Little Lamb</em> a million times won&#39;t make it easier for you to write a symphony.</p>
<p>It&#39;s very easy to be dismissive of the many &#39;me too&#39; startups hanging around San Francisco coffee shops.  There&#39;s real value and talent going on - go out and find it.</p>
</div><h3 class="heading"><a href="/articles/Dont-start-a-hosting-company.html">Don't start a hosting company</a></h3><div><p>I talk to a lot of people who are just starting their first startup.  An large percentage of them want to know what it&#39;ll take to start a webhosting company.  This isn&#39;t surprising, as web hosting companies like GoDaddy are very visible.  The first step to any project is some sort of hosting.  The technical challenges don&#39;t seem overwhelming to the beginner - chances are, they&#39;ve played with some sort of server already.  Most importantly, hosting services seem to make a <em>lot</em> of money.  To the uninitiated, this seems like a great area to enter.  In this essay, I hope to explain why you shouldn&#39;t start a hosting service, while also explaining more general pitfalls beginners encounter.</p>
<h5 id="current-market-size-rarely-matters">Current market size rarely matters</h5>
<p>Lots of beginners fall for the <a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2013/03/11/the-1-percent-fallacy/">1% fallacy</a> (the idea that all they need to succeed is 1% of the market) when selecting what to build.  They see large, entrenched players as a good sign - there&#39;s money to be made here.  Large companies are particularly keen on not letting an upstart steal their profits.  More than likely, they&#39;ll steal whatever makes you special and you&#39;ll lose your customers.</p>
<p>Every major tech company has had either an entirely new product or one that was ten times as good as the competition. &quot;Yet another hosting company&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it. [0]</p>
<p>Speaking of that...</p>
<h5 id="you-re-not-special">You&#39;re not special</h5>
<p>You&#39;ll need to do something to differentiate yourself from other companies - it&#39;s called a competitive advantage.  It&#39;ll be hard to compete on price with the big guys and their massive scale.  Most other factors are just as difficult - bandwidth, server power and uptime are all costly.  Ease of use may be one option.  Heroku made it incredibly easy for developers to get an app online and keep it updated.  Digital Ocean has won many customers based on their easy-to-use administration panel.  You&#39;d need to find a target demographic that doesn&#39;t have their particular interests served and build something for them.  The trouble is finding a niche in between developer-friendly solutions like DO and Heroku and non-technical people that just need a Wordpress install [1].</p>
<h5 id="it-s-not-easy">It&#39;s not easy</h5>
<p>I remember setting up my first server and finally coaxing Ubuntu 8.10 to life.  It&#39;s a wonderful experience seeing a web page you wrote load, and fairly easy to repeat once the basic steps are learned.  Selling web hosting space is <em>much</em> more difficult.  You&#39;ll need to consider how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolate different servers (cheaply!) so that users can only access their own data?</li>
<li>Give everyone a fair share of the server&#39;s resources?</li>
<li>Determine how much you bill for what?</li>
<li>Prevent hardware failure (and what do you do when the inevitable happens?)</li>
<li>Design a dashboard that people want to use (i.e. not cPanel)</li>
<li>Send email!</li>
<li>Deal with spammers using your service</li>
<li>Deal with the FBI when they accuse you of assisting software pirates (or worse!)</li>
</ul>
<p>This last section is not an explicit reason to not start a web hosting company, but as an example of how difficult starting anything is [2].  Most who want found web hosting companies chose hosting because &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing&quot; - even though they couldn&#39;t answer the above questions.  This shouldn&#39;t be insulting, everyone was a novice at some point.  A good exercise to learn more in this area is to use a competitor&#39;s product.  Go through the process slowly.  Think about what it will take to copy each of their features [3].</p>
<p>This being said, there are still plenty of opportunities to find in the startup space.  Your first, tenth or even hundredth idea doesn&#39;t have to be the one.  Keep building new things, learn from your mistakes, and eventually something will stick.</p>
<p>[0] It should be noted that while Google started in an already-crowded market, they had a product that was orders of magnitude better than the others.  For more on this, see: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_0dVHMpJlo</a></p>
<p>[1] An argument could be made that WP installs <em>are</em> a form of web hosting.  If I haven&#39;t convinced you to do something other than hosting, this may be a lucrative way to start.</p>
<p>[2] The business side of things has been deliberately left out.  However, these can be just as hard as the technical stuff.</p>
<p>[3] If you notice anything particularly annoying across the board, there may be opportunity there to do it <em>right</em> and differentiate yourself.</p>
