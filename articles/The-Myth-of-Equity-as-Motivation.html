      <h1 class="heading">The Myth of Equity as Motivation</h1><p>Virtually every startup job offers a percentage ownership of the hiring company as part of an employee&#39;s compensation package. According to AngelList, most startup software engineers in San Francisco can expect to receive 0.1%-4% of the company they work for.</p>
<p>This equity is provided in order to align incentives. Employees who own a stake in the company are compensated for the company&#39;s success and theoretically will work harder to achieve that success. In this post, I intend to show that this commonly-held belief is a myth. To be exact - equity in a startup does not incentivise an employee to work longer or harder.</p>
<p>Equity&#39;s largest motivation is at the financial level. There are many other reasons a startup employee might work extra hours (belief in the company&#39;s mission, threats of firing, the enjoyment of challenging puzzles, etc) but none of these are significantly impacted by equity. In order to determine equity&#39;s effect (or lack thereof) on motivation, we need to look at how the financial impact of an equity stake impacts an employee&#39;s motivation.</p>
<p>I find examples are best to work with, so let&#39;s examine a statistically-average Silicon Valley startup hacker named Bill. He&#39;s employee #7 and has been granted shares worth 0.5% of Wuzz.ly. His boss wants the team to put in extra hours in the coming weeks. Should he?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://grouptalent.com/blog/how-much-developers-make-per-city/">average hourly freelancing rate</a> for developers in San Francisco is $100. For the sake of argument, let&#39;s say Bill is fairly new to the freelancing world and (only being able to work nights &amp; weekends) has to lower his rate to $75/hr in order to remain fully booked.</p>
<p>If Bill freelances full-time over a weekend (sourcing clients through something like gun.io), he&#39;ll make a tidy 75 <em>16 = $1,200. In order to add $1,200 to his pocket equity-wise, Bill would need to add</em> $240,000* to Wuzz.ly&#39;s value in that same weekend. This assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wuzz.ly is successful enough that employees actually see cash for their equity (i.e. liquidation prefrences and debt financing don&#39;t take it all)</li>
<li>We don&#39;t discount the future value of Wuzz.ly stock (Bill can earn interest on freelancing income while he waits for the Wuzz.ly sale)</li>
<li>Wuzz.ly never takes on additional venture capital and dilutes Bill&#39;s position</li>
<li>Bill&#39;s employers have not threatened to fire anyone for not working over the weekend</li>
</ul>
<p>Engineers that can add a quarter of a million dollars to a company&#39;s value in a weekend don&#39;t charge $75/hr. World-class engineers like that usually end up charging $300+/hr, meaning Bill would need to create nearly a million dollars worth of value in one weekend (this has happened before, Facebook&#39;s Like button was <a href="http://www.quora.com/Whats-the-history-of-the-Awesome-Button-that-eventually-became-the-Like-button-on-Facebook">concieved at a company hackathon</a>).</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should stop using equity as a form of compensation as this is now standard practice. Lack of equity might cause an employee to feel left out and/or poorly compensated, neither of which is good for motivation or retention. Equity also allows us to feel more involved when the company succeeds.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I did find evidence that equity provides a powerful motivation in <em>public</em> companies. Managers with stock options that went up showed greater motivation at work for a year or more! This was only the case after employees saw a profit made off of their options, which makes it hard to draw correlations with privately-held startups.</p>
<p>Equity is still an incredibly-useful tool in a compensation package. I doubt a company could woo an engineer without it, despite the common recommendation to value it at nothing. The next time your boss &quot;suggests&quot; you work a weekend, I hope you have a greater understanding of how the numbers work out.</p>
