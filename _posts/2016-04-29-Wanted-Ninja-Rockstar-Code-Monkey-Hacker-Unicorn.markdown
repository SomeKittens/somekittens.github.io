We're looking for the best of the best - but as you can already tell from the title, we have no idea what that looks like.  We want someone experienced enough to implement our redicuoluos ideas but paradoxically _lacking_ the experience to realize what a raw deal we're offering.  Work long hours to [implement vague ideas with no autonomy](https://rkoutnik.com/2016/04/21/implementers-solvers-and-finders.html) for [vague promises of getting rich one day](https://rkoutnik.com/articles/The-Myth-of-Equity-as-Motivation.html).  After all, money's the only thing that motivates anyone, right?  Coding isn't a creative field, it's just telling the computer what to do.

You'll get to work with all of our C-levels as they order you around on a daily basis.  We're an "Agile" team, so long as that means cutting corners to meet sales deadlines.  We practice HN-driven-development.  Plan on working ~100+ hours a week during sprints. If that scares you, don't apply.  We don't want people who are scared by silly things like reality.

Get in on the ground floor to a catastrophe that's sure to hit the front page of TechCrunch!

Must haves:

 - White
 - Male
 - Unshakable confidence due to the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
 - No interest in a life outside of the company
 - 5 years of experience in a three-year-old technology

Nice to haves:

 - Enough knowledge to convince a non-technical person you're an expert in a handful of bleeding-edge technologies
 - Sneering disdain for the proven tech you should be building with
 - A GitHub profile that shows you're already willing to work for free in your off hours

Perks:

 - Yes you'll get all the usual benefits, but if you're really going for perks, Google is your best bet! If you want to make an impact, then please apply.
 - 401k?  Hah, you won't need that with how rich your sliver of equity will make you!
 - We'll have a large variety of alchohol in the office as well as an assortment of video games for the perfect frat environment
 - Office located in trendy downtown district in order to burn VC cash faster

Salary: Something that we'll claim is top-of-market but is well below.  We'll offer the low end of the range, citing lack of experience with some framework that hasn't left beta.

Equity: 0.1% - 2% for the 'right person'.
